# cairn-work

Use the `cairn-work` skill.

Read the installed Cairn runtime locator at `{{CAIRN_RUNTIME_LOCATOR_JSON}}`. Resolve Cairn scripts, skills, and policy resources through that locator (`pluginRoot`, `entrypoints.cli`, `resources.modelGuidance`); only work artifacts and state belong to the target project. If the shared runtime or locator is missing, unreadable, or inconsistent, stop every dependent mirror and recover through published/global `cairn doctor` followed by `cairn upgrade`, never through another mirror.

Goal: execute the active goal's current task without bypassing complexity triage, then keep advancing tasks until goal-level final review completes or the goal is explicitly paused, blocked, or cancelled. Quick Path work has no plan or goal: implement, run one focused check plus the project's normal check, and report; escalate to Light Path (plan + goal) before further edits if any Quick Path criterion fails.

Record the code checkpoint after exact file/caller/test inspection immediately before the first edit. After editing begins, a new Heavy Path signal promotes Light Path to Heavy Path: stop further edits, mark affected evidence stale, synchronize the plan artifact, `goal replan` roadmap, and native UI plan, and repeat the code checkpoint. Choose each task's model by its nature (fast, balanced, stronger, strongest) and pass it with effort through the host option; request Light `medium`, Heavy `high`, final verification/review `xhigh`.

Procedure:

1. Every agent reads project-root `MEMORY.md` when present and continues without repository memory when absent before selecting or executing a task.
2. Read `PLAN.md`, the detailed plan, relevant memory notes, and the `cairn://` model guidance recorded in the plan through the installed runtime.
3. Read the current task with `goal task status`; run `goal ready` and delegate independent ready tasks to parallel workers (same worktree, disjoint `writeScope`). Fold a new request into an unfinished goal with `goal replan` instead of cancelling it. Copy the session-start hook's `Cairn CLI:` prefix literally; never store it in a shell variable. `--root` may be omitted when the cwd is inside the repository.
4. Confirm tool readiness by invoking Node with the locator's absolute `entrypoints.cli`, `toolcheck`, and `--root` (installation only with explicit approval) and the recorded route.
5. Before implementation, spend reasoning on a focused executable test contract covering requirements, invariants, boundaries, and failure modes. Confirm the intended failure, then give the `worker` the contract, failing evidence, exact file ownership, and constraints and require the minimum change.
6. Run module acceptance and surface integration through `goal verify -- ...`; `--kind "moduleAcceptance|surfaceIntegration"` records both from one run. Treat tool exit codes as authoritative and expand context only around failing tests. Heavy Path records explicit `Tests:` evidence.
7. Never edit, weaken, skip, or delete existing tests, fixtures, or verification commands to make a gate pass unless the plan records the contract change. Reproduce reported defects before fixing, and after a fix search for other implementations of the same rule or pattern.
8. Inspect package lifecycle scripts and run normal `npm pack --dry-run` by default. Content-producing or unknown lifecycle scripts must never use `--ignore-scripts`; only absent or proven content-neutral scripts may use it while the full check remains fresh.
9. Relevant mutation makes the current task's evidence stale; rerun it before completing the task. Do not rerun earlier tasks' checks; finish with one goal-level check through `goal finish -- ...`. Missing, failed, skipped, stale, or placeholder evidence never completes work. `goal stats` measures receipt reruns.
10. Resolve the skill's reference files through the locator's `pluginRoot` and read them only when needed: `cairn://skills/cairn-work/verification.md`, `cairn://skills/cairn-work/delegation.md`, `cairn://skills/cairn-work/recovery.md`, and `cairn://skills/cairn-work/heavy-path.md` (Heavy route only).
11. Update the plan, goal state, and `PLAN.md` only after evidence exists. If the user asks a side question, status question, or narrow clarification while this task is still active, answer it briefly and then resume the previous active work unless the user explicitly asks to pause, stop, or switch tasks.
12. Use the OS locale for user-visible responses and generated or updated documentation, plans, and memory artifacts unless the user asks for another language.
