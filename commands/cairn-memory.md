# cairn-memory

Use the `cairn-memory` skill.

Prerequisite: resolve the installed Cairn runtime from the plugin or skill locator. If the shared runtime or locator is missing, unreadable, or inconsistent, stop every dependent mirror; run published/global `cairn doctor`, then `cairn upgrade` to recover it. Never repair through another mirror or look for Cairn scripts in the target repository.

Goal: create or update repository memory without asking the user for discoverable facts.

Procedure:

1. Run the installed plugin state initialization script with an explicit target `--root`.
2. Every agent reads project-root `MEMORY.md` when present and continues without repository memory when absent before assigned discovery or update work.
3. Explore repository facts with focused tools.
4. Use `explorer` for read-only domain discovery and contradiction checks when available; use `worker` for exact references, command checks, and bounded evidence capture. When subagent tools are available, each agent may recursively delegate bounded sub-tasks to subagents. Tell every delegated agent and child subagent to read the project-root `MEMORY.md` before work, keep scope, and preserve others' edits.
5. Write details to `docs/memory/<domain>.md` with a `Summary:` line under the H1 (one line, at most 120 characters: what the note answers and when to read it). When a lesson or correction recurs and is machine-checkable, encode it as a test, lint rule, script, or hook instead of more prose; memory keeps judgment rules and a pointer to the enforcing check.
6. Keep `MEMORY.md` as a short index: one line per note under `## Domain Knowledge`; a note link in another section is a mention that `index` never rewrites. Run the installed Cairn CLI with `memory index --root <repoRoot>` to add unlisted notes and refresh changed summaries (`--dry-run` previews; it never deletes entries and writes nothing when the insertion point is inside an unclosed code fence), then `memory check --root <repoRoot>` and fix the unindexed notes, dead links, duplicates, stale summaries, or control characters it reports.
7. Use the OS locale for user-visible responses and generated or updated documentation, plans, and memory artifacts unless the user asks for another language.
